Snowflake,Explore,"Languages, Frameworks, and Platforms",FALSE,"<p>Since we last mentioned <strong><a href=""https://www.snowflake.com/"">Snowflake</a></strong> in the Radar, we've gained more experience with it as well as with <a href=""/radar/techniques/data-mesh"">data mesh</a> as an alternative to data warehouses and lakes. Snowflake continues to impress with features like time travel, zero-copy cloning, data sharing and its marketplace. We also haven't found anything we don't like about it, all of which has led to our consultants generally preferring it over the alternatives. Redshift is moving toward storage and compute separation, which has been a strong point of Snowflake, but even with Redshift Spectrum it isn't as convenient and flexible to use, partly because it is bound by its Postgres heritage (we do still like <a href=""/radar/platforms/postgresql-for-nosql"">Postgres</a>, by the way). Federated queries can be a reason to go with Redshift. When it comes to operations, Snowflake is much simpler to run. <a href=""/radar/platforms/bigquery"">BigQuery</a>, which is another alternative, is very easy to operate, but in a multicloud setup Snowflake is a better choice.

Apache Pinot,Explore,"Languages, Frameworks, and Platforms",TRUE,"<p><strong><a href=""https://pinot.apache.org/"">Apache Pinot</a></strong> is a distributed OLAP data store, built to deliver real-time analytics with low latency. It can ingest from batch data sources (such as Hadoop HDFS, Amazon S3, Azure ADLS or Google Cloud Storage) as well as stream data sources (such as Apache Kafka). If the need is user-facing, low-latency analytics, SQL-on-Hadoop solutions don't offer the low latency that is needed. Modern OLAP engines like Apache Pinot (or <a href=""https://druid.apache.org/"">Apache Druid</a> and <a href=""https://clickhouse.tech/"">Clickhouse</a> among others) can achieve much lower latency and are particularly suited in contexts where fast analytics, such as aggregations, are needed on immutable data, possibly, with real-time data ingestion. Originally built by LinkedIn, Apache Pinot entered Apache incubation in late 2018 and has since added a plugin architecture and SQL support among other key capabilities. Apache Pinot can be fairly complex to operate and has many moving parts, but if your data volumes are large enough and you need low-latency query capability, we recommend you assess Apache Pinot.</p>",y
DataHub,Explore,"Languages, Frameworks, and Platforms",TRUE,"<p>Since we first mentioned <a href=""/radar/techniques/data-discoverability"">data discoverability</a> in the Radar, LinkedIn has evolved <a href=""https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2016/03/open-sourcing-wherehows--a-data-discovery-and-lineage-portal"">WhereHows</a> to <strong><a href=""https://github.com/linkedin/datahub"">DataHub</a></strong>, the next generation platform that addresses data discoverability via an extensible metadata system. Instead of crawling and pulling metadata, DataHub adopts a push-based model where individual components of the data ecosystem publish metadata via an API or a stream to the central platform. This push-based integration shifts the ownership from the central entity to individual teams making them accountable for their metadata. As more and more companies are trying to become data driven, having a system that helps with data discovery and understanding data quality and lineage is critical, and we recommend you assess DataHub in that capacity.</p>",y

NATS,Explore,"Languages, Frameworks, and Platforms",TRUE,"<p><a href=""https://nats.io/about/""><strong>NATS</strong></a> is a fast, secure message queueing system with an unusually wide range of features and potential deployment targets. At first glance, you would be forgiven for asking why the world needs another message queueing system. Message queues have been around in various forms for nearly as long as businesses have been using computers and have undergone years of refinement and optimization for various tasks. But NATS has several interesting characteristics and is unique in its ability to scale from embedded controllers to global, cloud-hosted superclusters. We're particularly intrigued by NATS's intent to support a continuous streaming flow of data from mobile devices and IoT and through a network of interconnected systems. However, some tricky issues need to be addressed, not the least of which is ensuring consumers see only the messages and topics to which they're allowed access, especially when the network spans organizational boundaries. NATS 2.0 introduced a security and access control framework that supports multitenant clusters where accounts restrict a user's access to queues and topics. Written in Go, NATS has primarily been embraced by the Go language community. Although clients exist for pretty much all widely used programming languages, the Go client is by far the most popular. However, some of our developers have found that all the language client libraries tend to reflect the Go origins of codebase. Increasing bandwidth and processing power on small, wireless devices means that the volume of data businesses must consume in real time will only increase. Assess NATS as a possible platform for streaming that data within and among businesses.</p>",y
Pulumi,Explore,"Languages, Frameworks, and Platforms",FALSE,"<p>We've seen interest in <strong><a href=""https://pulumi.io/"">Pulumi</a></strong> slowly but steadily rising. Pulumi fills a gaping hole in the infrastructure coding world where <a href=""/radar/tools/terraform"">Terraform</a> maintains a firm hold. While Terraform is a tried-and-true standby, its declarative nature suffers from inadequate abstraction facilities and limited testability. Terraform is adequate when the infrastructure is entirely static, but dynamic infrastructure definitions call for a real programming language. Pulumi distinguishes itself by allowing configurations to be written in <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/typescript"">TypeScript</a>/JavaScript, <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/python-3"">Python</a> and <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/go-language"">Go</a> — no markup language or templating required. Pulumi is tightly focused on cloud-native architectures — including containers, serverless functions and data services — and provides good support for <a href=""/radar/platforms/kubernetes"">Kubernetes</a>. Recently, <a href=""/radar/platforms/aws-cloud-development-kit"">AWS CDK</a> has mounted a challenge, but Pulumi remains the only cloud-neutral tool in this area.

axe-core,Explore,"Development, Test and Release Tools",TRUE,"<p>Making the web inclusive requires serious attention to ensure accessibility is considered <em>and</em> validated at all stages of software delivery.

GitHub Actions,Explore,"Development, Test and Release Tools",TRUE,"<p>CI servers and build tools are some of the oldest and most widely used in our kit. They run the gamut from simple cloud-hosted services to complex, code-defined pipeline servers that support fleets of build machines. Given our experience and the wide range of options already available, we were initially skeptical when <strong><a href=""https://docs.github.com/en/actions"">GitHub Actions</a></strong> were introduced as another mechanism to manage the build and integration workflow. But the opportunity for developers to start small and easily customize behavior means that GitHub Actions are moving toward the default category for smaller projects. It's hard to argue with the convenience of having the build tool integrated directly into the source code repository. An enthusiastic community has emerged around this feature and that means a wide range of user-contributed tools and workflows are available to get started. Tools vendors are also getting on board via the <a href=""https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions"">GitHub Marketplace</a>. However, we still recommend you proceed with caution. Although code and <a href=""/radar/tools/git"">Git</a> history can be exported into alternative hosts, a development workflow based on GitHub Actions can't. Also, use your best judgment to determine when a project is large or complex enough to warrant an independently supported pipeline tool.

Spectral,Explore,"Development, Test and Release Tools",TRUE,"<p>One of the patterns we've seen repeat itself in this publication is that static error- and style-checking tools emerge quickly after a new language gains popularity. These tools are generically known as linters — after the classic and beloved Unix utility <em>lint</em>, which statically analyzes C code. We like these tools because they catch errors early, before code even gets compiled. The latest instance of this pattern is <strong><a href=""https://stoplight.io/open-source/spectral/"">Spectral</a></strong>, a linter for YAML and JSON. Although Spectral is a generic tool for these formats, its main target is OpenAPI (the evolution of <a href=""/radar/tools/swagger"">Swagger</a>) and <a href=""/radar/tools/asyncapi"">AsyncAPI</a>. Spectral ships with a comprehensive set of out-of-the-box rules for these specs that can save developers headaches when designing and implementing APIs or event-driven collaboration. These rules check for proper API parameter specifications or the existence of a license statement in the spec, among other things. While this tool is a welcome addition to the API development workflow, it does raise the question of whether a non-executable specification should be so complex as to require an error-checking technique designed for programming languages. Perhaps developers should be writing code instead of specs?</p>",y

AWS Data Wrangler,Explore,"Languages, Frameworks, and Platforms",TRUE,"<p><strong><a href=""https://github.com/awslabs/aws-data-wrangler"">AWS Data Wrangler</a></strong> is an open-source library that extends the capabilities of <a href=""https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas"">Pandas</a> to AWS by connecting data frames to AWS data-related services. In addition to Pandas, this library leverages <a href=""https://github.com/apache/arrow"">Apache Arrow</a> and <a href=""https://github.com/boto/boto3"">Boto3</a> to expose <a href=""https://aws-data-wrangler.readthedocs.io/en/2.5.0/api.html"">several APIs</a> to load, transform and save data from data lakes and data warehouses. An important limitation is that you can't do large distributed data pipelines with this library. However, you can leverage the native data services — like Athena, Redshift and Timestream — to do the heavy lifting and pull data in order to express complex transformations that are well suited for data frames. We've used AWS Data Wrangler in production and like that it lets you focus on writing transformations without spending too much time on the connectivity to AWS data services.</p>",y
FastAPI,Explore,"Languages, Frameworks, and Platforms",TRUE,"<p>We're seeing more teams adopting Python as the preferred language to build solutions, not just for data science but for back-end services too.

Kotlin Flow,Explore,"Languages, Frameworks, and Platforms",TRUE,"<p>The introduction of <a href=""https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html"">coroutines to Kotlin</a> opened the door for several innovations — <strong><a href=""https://kotlinlang.org/docs/flow.html"">Kotlin Flow</a></strong> is one of them, directly integrated into the coroutines library. It's an implementation of Reactive Streams on top of coroutines. Unlike <a href=""https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava"">RxJava</a>, flows are a native Kotlin API similar to the familiar sequence API with methods that include <code>map</code> and <code>filter</code>. Like sequences, flows are <em>cold</em>, meaning that the values of the sequence are only constructed when needed. All of this makes writing multithreaded code much simpler and easier to understand than other approaches. The <code>toList</code> method, predictably, converts a flow into a list which is a common pattern in tests.</p>",y

Flutter for Web,Explore,"Languages, Frameworks, and Platforms",TRUE,"<p>So far, <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/flutter"">Flutter</a> has primarily supported native iOS and Android applications. However, the Flutter team's vision is to support building applications on every platform. <strong>Flutter for Web</strong> is one step in that direction — it allows us to build apps for iOS, Android and the browser from the same codebase. It has been available for over a year now on the ""Beta"" channel, but with the recent Flutter 2.0 release, Flutter for Web has hit the stable milestone. In the initial release of web support, the Flutter team is focusing on <a href=""https://web.dev/what-are-pwas/"">progressive web apps</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application"">single-page apps</a> and expanding existing mobile apps to the web. The application and framework code (all in <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/google-dart"">Dart</a>) are compiled to JavaScript instead of ARM machine code, which is used for mobile applications. Flutter’s web engine offers a choice of two renderers: an HTML renderer, which uses HTML, CSS, Canvas and SVG, and a CanvasKit renderer that uses <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/webassembly"">WebAssembly</a> and WebGL to render Skia paint commands to the browser canvas.

Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile,Explore,"Languages, Frameworks, and Platforms",TRUE,"<p>Following the trend of cross-platform mobile development, <strong><a href=""https://kotlinlang.org/docs/mobile/home.html"">Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile</a></strong> (KMM) is a new entry in this space. KMM is an SDK provided by JetBrains that leverages the <a href=""https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html"">multiplatform capabilities</a> in <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/kotlin"">Kotlin</a> and includes tools and features designed to make the end-to-end experience of building mobile cross-platform applications more enjoyable and efficient. With KMM you write code once for business logic and the app core in Kotlin and then  share it with both Android and iOS applications. Write platform-specific code only when necessary, for example, to take advantage of native UI elements; and the specific code is kept in different views for each platform.

React Hook Form,Explore,"Languages, Frameworks, and Platforms",TRUE,"<p>Building forms for the web remains one of the perennial challenges of front-end development, in particular with <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/react-js"">React</a>. Many of our teams working with React have been using <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/formik"">Formik</a> to make this easier, but some are now assessing <strong><a href=""https://react-hook-form.com/"">React Hook Form</a></strong> as a potential alternative. <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/react-hooks"">React Hooks</a> already existed when React Hook Form was created, so it could use them as a first-class concept: the framework is registering and tracking form elements as uncontrolled components via a hook, thereby significantly reducing the need for re-rendering. It's also quite lightweight in size and in the amount of boilerplate code needed.</p>",y
Webpack 5 Module Federation,Explore,"Languages, Frameworks, and Platforms",TRUE,"<p>The release of the <strong><a href=""https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/"">Webpack 5 Module Federation</a></strong> feature has been highly anticipated by developers of <a href=""/radar/techniques/micro-frontends"">micro frontend</a> architectures. The feature introduces a more standardized way to optimize how module dependencies and shared code are managed and loaded. Module federation allows for the specification of shared modules, which helps with the deduplication of dependencies across micro frontends by loading code used by multiple modules only once. It also lets you distinguish between local and remote modules, where the remote modules are not actually part of the build itself but loaded asynchronously. Compared to build-time dependencies like npm packages, this can significantly simplify the deployment of a module update with many downstream dependencies. Be aware, though, that this requires you to bundle all of your micro frontends with Webpack, as opposed to approaches such as <a href=""/radar/techniques/import-maps-for-micro-frontends"">import maps</a>, which might eventually become part of the W3C standard.</p>",y

Homemade infrastructure-as-code (IaC) products,Deprecate,"Languages, Frameworks, and Platforms",TRUE,"<p>Products supported by companies or communities are in constant evolution, at least the ones that get traction in the industry.
