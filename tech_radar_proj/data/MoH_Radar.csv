Apache Pinot,Explore,"Languages, Frameworks, and Platforms",TRUE,"<p><strong><a href=""https://pinot.apache.org/"">Apache Pinot</a></strong> is a distributed OLAP data store, built to deliver real-time analytics with low latency. It can ingest from batch data sources (such as Hadoop HDFS, Amazon S3, Azure ADLS or Google Cloud Storage) as well as stream data sources (such as Apache Kafka). If the need is user-facing, low-latency analytics, SQL-on-Hadoop solutions don't offer the low latency that is needed. Modern OLAP engines like Apache Pinot (or <a href=""https://druid.apache.org/"">Apache Druid</a> and <a href=""https://clickhouse.tech/"">Clickhouse</a> among others) can achieve much lower latency and are particularly suited in contexts where fast analytics, such as aggregations, are needed on immutable data, possibly, with real-time data ingestion. Originally built by LinkedIn, Apache Pinot entered Apache incubation in late 2018 and has since added a plugin architecture and SQL support among other key capabilities.

Kafka API without Kafka,Explore,"Languages, Frameworks, and Platforms",TRUE,"<p>As more businesses turn to events as a way to share data among microservices, collect analytics or feed data lakes, <a href=""/radar/tools/apache-kafka"">Apache Kafka</a> has become a favorite platform to support an event-driven architectural style. Although Kafka was a revolutionary concept in scalable persistent messaging, a lot of moving parts are required to make it work, including ZooKeeper, brokers, partitions, and mirrors. While these can be particularly tricky to implement and operate, they do offer great flexibility and power when needed, especially at an industrial enterprise scale. Because of the high barrier to entry presented by the full Kafka ecosystem, we welcome the recent explosion of platforms offering the <strong>Kafka API without Kafka</strong>. Recent entries such as <a href=""https://github.com/streamnative/kop"">Kafka on Pulsar</a> and <a href=""/radar/platforms/redpanda"">Redpanda</a> offer alternative architectures, and <a href=""https://github.com/Azure/azure-event-hubs-for-kafka"">Azure Event Hubs for Kafka</a> provides some compatibility with Kafka producer and consumer APIs. Some features of Kafka, like the streams client library, are not compatible with these alternative brokers, so there are still reasons to choose Kafka over alternative brokers. It remains to be seen, however, if developers actually adopt this strategy or if it is merely an attempt by competitors to lure users away from the Kafka platform. Ultimately, perhaps Kafka's most enduring impact could be the convenient protocol and API provided to clients.</p>",n
NATS,Explore,"Languages, Frameworks, and Platforms",TRUE,"<p><a href=""https://nats.io/about/""><strong>NATS</strong></a> is a fast, secure message queueing system with an unusually wide range of features and potential deployment targets. At first glance, you would be forgiven for asking why the world needs another message queueing system. Message queues have been around in various forms for nearly as long as businesses have been using computers and have undergone years of refinement and optimization for various tasks. But NATS has several interesting characteristics and is unique in its ability to scale from embedded controllers to global, cloud-hosted superclusters. We're particularly intrigued by NATS's intent to support a continuous streaming flow of data from mobile devices and IoT and through a network of interconnected systems. However, some tricky issues need to be addressed, not the least of which is ensuring consumers see only the messages and topics to which they're allowed access, especially when the network spans organizational boundaries. NATS 2.0 introduced a security and access control framework that supports multitenant clusters where accounts restrict a user's access to queues and topics. Written in Go, NATS has primarily been embraced by the Go language community. Although clients exist for pretty much all widely used programming languages, the Go client is by far the most popular. However, some of our developers have found that all the language client libraries tend to reflect the Go origins of codebase. Increasing bandwidth and processing power on small, wireless devices means that the volume of data businesses must consume in real time will only increase. Assess NATS as a possible platform for streaming that data within and among businesses.</p>",y

Angular Testing Library,Explore,"Languages, Frameworks, and Platforms",TRUE,"<p>As we continue developing web applications in JavaScript, we continue enjoying the <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/testing-library"">Testing Library</a> approach of testing applications; and carry on exploring and gaining experience with its packages — beyond that of <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/react-testing-library"">React Testing Library</a>. <strong><a href=""https://testing-library.com/docs/angular-testing-library/intro/"">Angular Testing Library</a></strong> brings all the benefits of its family when testing UI components in a user-centric way, pushing for more maintainable tests focused primarily on behavior rather than testing UI implementation details. Although it falls short in documentation, Angular Testing Library does provide <a href=""https://github.com/testing-library/angular-testing-library/tree/master/apps/example-app/app/examples"">good sample tests</a> that helped us in getting started faster for various cases.

AWS Data Wrangler,Explore,"Languages, Frameworks, and Platforms",TRUE,"<p><strong><a href=""https://github.com/awslabs/aws-data-wrangler"">AWS Data Wrangler</a></strong> is an open-source library that extends the capabilities of <a href=""https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas"">Pandas</a> to AWS by connecting data frames to AWS data-related services. In addition to Pandas, this library leverages <a href=""https://github.com/apache/arrow"">Apache Arrow</a> and <a href=""https://github.com/boto/boto3"">Boto3</a> to expose <a href=""https://aws-data-wrangler.readthedocs.io/en/2.5.0/api.html"">several APIs</a> to load, transform and save data from data lakes and data warehouses. An important limitation is that you can't do large distributed data pipelines with this library. However, you can leverage the native data services — like Athena, Redshift and Timestream — to do the heavy lifting and pull data in order to express complex transformations that are well suited for data frames. We've used AWS Data Wrangler in production and like that it lets you focus on writing transformations without spending too much time on the connectivity to AWS data services.</p>",y
Blazor,Explore,"Languages, Frameworks, and Platforms",FALSE,"<p>Although JavaScript and its ecosystem is dominant in the web UI development space, new opportunities are opening up with the emergence of <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/webassembly"">WebAssembly</a>. <strong><a href=""https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor"">Blazor</a></strong> continues to demand our attention; it's producing good results with our teams building interactive rich user interfaces using C# on top of WebAssembly. The fact that our teams can use C# on the frontend too allows them to share code and reuse existing libraries.

Additionally, this framework and its ecosystem include features such as API documentation using OpenAPI that allow our teams to focus on the business functionalities and quickly create REST APIs, which makes FastAPI a good alternative to existing solutions in this space.</p>",y
io-ts,Explore,"Languages, Frameworks, and Platforms",FALSE,"<p>We've really enjoyed using <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/typescript"">TypeScript</a> for a while now and love the safety that the strong typing provides. However, getting data into the bounds of the type system — from, for example, a call to a back-end service — can lead to run-time errors. One library that helps solve this problem is <strong><a href=""https://gcanti.github.io/io-ts/"">io-ts</a></strong>. It bridges the gap between compile-time type-checking and run-time consumption of external data by providing encode and decode functions. It can also be used as a custom type guard. As we gain more experience with io-ts in our work, our initially positive impressions are confirmed, and we still like the elegance of its approach.</p>",n
Kotlin Flow,Explore,"Languages, Frameworks, and Platforms",TRUE,"<p>The introduction of <a href=""https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html"">coroutines to Kotlin</a> opened the door for several innovations — <strong><a href=""https://kotlinlang.org/docs/flow.html"">Kotlin Flow</a></strong> is one of them, directly integrated into the coroutines library. It's an implementation of Reactive Streams on top of coroutines. Unlike <a href=""https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava"">RxJava</a>, flows are a native Kotlin API similar to the familiar sequence API with methods that include <code>map</code> and <code>filter</code>. Like sequences, flows are <em>cold</em>, meaning that the values of the sequence are only constructed when needed. All of this makes writing multithreaded code much simpler and easier to understand than other approaches. The <code>toList</code> method, predictably, converts a flow into a list which is a common pattern in tests.</p>",y
LitElement,Explore,"Languages, Frameworks, and Platforms",FALSE,"<p>Steady progress has been made since we first wrote about <a href=""/radar/platforms/web-components-standard"">Web Components</a> in 2014. <strong><a href=""https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/"">LitElement</a></strong>, part of the <a href=""https://www.polymer-project.org/"">Polymer Project</a>, is a simple library that you can use to create lightweight web components. It's really just a base class that removes the need for a lot of the common boilerplate, making writing web components a lot easier. We've had success using it on projects, and as we see the technology maturing and the library being well liked, LitElement is becoming more commonly used in our Web Components-based projects.</p>",n

On-demand modules,Explore,"Languages, Frameworks, and Platforms",TRUE,"<p><strong><a href=""https://developer.android.com/codelabs/on-demand-dynamic-delivery#0"">On-demand modules</a></strong> for Android is a framework that allows tailored APKs containing only required functionality to be downloaded and installed for a suitably structured app. This could be worth trialing for larger apps where download speed might be an issue, or if a user is likely only to use some functionality on initial installation. It can also simplify the handling of multiple devices without requiring different APKs. A similar framework is available for <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/app-clips/"">iOS</a>.</p>",n
Streamlit,Explore,"Languages, Frameworks, and Platforms",FALSE,"<p><strong><a href=""https://www.streamlit.io/"">Streamlit</a></strong> is an open-source application framework in Python used by data scientists for building interactive data applications. Tuning machine-learning models takes time; instead of going back and forth on the main application (the one that uses these models), we've found value in quickly building standalone prototypes in Streamlit and gathering feedback during experimentation cycles. Streamlit stands out from competitors such as <a href=""/radar/tools/dash"">Dash</a> because of its focus on rapid prototyping and support for a wide range of visualization libraries, including <a href=""https://plotly.com/"">Plotly</a> and <a href=""/radar/tools/bokeh"">Bokeh</a>.

SWR,Explore,"Languages, Frameworks, and Platforms",FALSE,"<p>When used in appropriate circumstances, our teams have found that the <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/react-hooks"">React Hooks</a> library <strong><a href=""https://github.com/vercel/swr"">SWR</a></strong> can result in cleaner code and much improved performance. SWR implements the <a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5861"">stale-while-revalidate</a> HTTP caching strategy, first returning data from cache (stale), then sending the fetch request (revalidate) and finally refreshing the values with the up-to-date response. We caution teams to only use the SWR caching strategy when an application is supposed to return stale data. Note that <a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616"">HTTP</a> requires that caches respond to a request with the most up-to-date response; only in <em>carefully considered circumstances</em> is a stale response allowed to be returned.</p>",n
TrustKit,Explore,"Languages, Frameworks, and Platforms",TRUE,"<p><a href=""https://owasp.org/www-community/controls/Certificate_and_Public_Key_Pinning"">SSL public key pinning</a> is tricky.

.NET 5,Explore,"Languages, Frameworks, and Platforms",TRUE,"<p>We don't call out every new .NET version in the Radar, but <strong>.NET 5</strong> represents a significant step forward in bringing .NET Core and .NET Framework into a single platform. Organizations should start to develop a strategy to migrate their development environments — a fragmented mix of frameworks depending on the deployment target — to a single version of .NET 5 or 6 when it becomes available. The advantage of this approach will be a common development platform regardless of the intended environment: Windows, Linux, cross-platform mobile devices (via <a href=""/radar/tools/xamarin"">Xamarin</a>) or the browser (using <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/blazor"">Blazor</a>). While polyglot development will remain the preferred approach for companies with the engineering culture to support it, others will find it more efficient to standardize on a single platform for .NET development. For now, we want to keep this in the Assess ring to see how well the final unified framework performs in .NET 6.</p>",n

Flutter for Web,Explore,"Languages, Frameworks, and Platforms",TRUE,"<p>So far, <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/flutter"">Flutter</a> has primarily supported native iOS and Android applications. However, the Flutter team's vision is to support building applications on every platform. <strong>Flutter for Web</strong> is one step in that direction — it allows us to build apps for iOS, Android and the browser from the same codebase. It has been available for over a year now on the ""Beta"" channel, but with the recent Flutter 2.0 release, Flutter for Web has hit the stable milestone. In the initial release of web support, the Flutter team is focusing on <a href=""https://web.dev/what-are-pwas/"">progressive web apps</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application"">single-page apps</a> and expanding existing mobile apps to the web. The application and framework code (all in <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/google-dart"">Dart</a>) are compiled to JavaScript instead of ARM machine code, which is used for mobile applications. Flutter’s web engine offers a choice of two renderers: an HTML renderer, which uses HTML, CSS, Canvas and SVG, and a CanvasKit renderer that uses <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/webassembly"">WebAssembly</a> and WebGL to render Skia paint commands to the browser canvas.

Jotai and Zustand,Explore,"Languages, Frameworks, and Platforms",TRUE,"<p>In the previous Radar, we commented on the beginning of a phase of experimentation with state management in <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/react-js"">React</a> applications. We moved <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/redux"">Redux</a> back into the Trial ring, documenting that it is no longer our default choice, and we mentioned Facebook's <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/recoil"">Recoil</a>. In this volume we want to highlight <strong><a href=""https://github.com/pmndrs/jotai"">Jotai</a> and <a href=""https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand"">Zustand</a></strong>: Both are state management libraries for React; both aim to be small and simple to use; and, perhaps not by complete coincidence, both names are translations of the word <em>state</em> into Japanese and German, respectively. Beyond these similarities, however, they differ in their design. Jotai's design is closer to that of Recoil in that state consists of atoms stored within the React component tree, whereas Zustand stores the state outside of React in a single state object, much like the approach taken by Redux. The authors of Jotai provide a helpful <a href=""https://github.com/pmndrs/jotai/blob/master/docs/introduction/comparison.md"">checklist</a> to decide when to use which.</p>",n
Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile,Explore,"Languages, Frameworks, and Platforms",TRUE,"<p>Following the trend of cross-platform mobile development, <strong><a href=""https://kotlinlang.org/docs/mobile/home.html"">Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile</a></strong> (KMM) is a new entry in this space. KMM is an SDK provided by JetBrains that leverages the <a href=""https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html"">multiplatform capabilities</a> in <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/kotlin"">Kotlin</a> and includes tools and features designed to make the end-to-end experience of building mobile cross-platform applications more enjoyable and efficient. With KMM you write code once for business logic and the app core in Kotlin and then  share it with both Android and iOS applications. Write platform-specific code only when necessary, for example, to take advantage of native UI elements; and the specific code is kept in different views for each platform. Although still in Alpha, Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile is <a href=""https://kotlinlang.org/docs/mobile/kmm-evolution.html"">evolving rapidly</a>. We'll certainly keep an eye on it, and you should too.</p>",y
LVGL,Explore,"Languages, Frameworks, and Platforms",TRUE,"<p>With the increasing popularity of smart home and wearable devices, demand for intuitive graphical user interfaces (GUIs)is increasing. However, if you're engaged in embedded device development, rather than Android/iOS, GUI development may take a lot of effort. As an open-source embedded graphics library, <strong><a href=""https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl"">LVGL</a></strong> has become increasingly popular. LVGL has been adapted to mainstream embedded platforms such as NXP, STM32, PIC, Arduino, and ESP32. It has a very small memory footprint: 64 kB flash and 8 kB RAM is enough to make it work, and it can run smoothly on various Cortex-M0 low-power MCUs. LVGL supports input types such as touchscreen, mouse and buttons and contains more than 30 controls, including TileView suitable for smart watches. The MIT license it chose doesn’t restrict enterprise and commercial use. Our teams’ feedback on this tool has been positive and one of our projects using LVGL is already in production, more specifically in small batch manufacturing.</p>",n
React Hook Form,Explore,"Languages, Frameworks, and Platforms",TRUE,"<p>Building forms for the web remains one of the perennial challenges of front-end development, in particular with <a href=""/radar/languages-and-frameworks/react-js"">React</a>.

It's also quite lightweight in size and in the amount of boilerplate code needed.</p>",y
River,Explore,"Languages, Frameworks, and Platforms",TRUE,"<p>At the heart of many approaches to machine learning lies the creation of a model from a set of training data. Once a model is created, it can be used over and over again. However, the world isn't stationary, and often the model needs to change as new data becomes available. Simply re-running the model creation step can be slow and <a href=""https://medium.com/syncedreview/the-staggering-cost-of-training-sota-ai-models-e329e80fa82"">costly</a>. Incremental learning addresses this issue, making it possible to learn from streams of data incrementally to react to change faster. As a bonus the compute and memory requirements are lower and predictable. In our implementations we've had good experience with the <strong><a href=""https://riverml.xyz/dev/"">River</a></strong> framework, but so far we've added checks, sometimes manual, after updates to the model.</p>",n
Webpack 5 Module Federation,Explore,"Languages, Frameworks, and Platforms",TRUE,"<p>The release of the <strong><a href=""https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-federation/"">Webpack 5 Module Federation</a></strong> feature has been highly anticipated by developers of <a href=""/radar/techniques/micro-frontends"">micro frontend</a> architectures. The feature introduces a more standardized way to optimize how module dependencies and shared code are managed and loaded. Module federation allows for the specification of shared modules, which helps with the deduplication of dependencies across micro frontends by loading code used by multiple modules only once. It also lets you distinguish between local and remote modules, where the remote modules are not actually part of the build itself but loaded asynchronously. Compared to build-time dependencies like npm packages, this can significantly simplify the deployment of a module update with many downstream dependencies. Be aware, though, that this requires you to bundle all of your micro frontends with Webpack, as opposed to approaches such as <a href=""/radar/techniques/import-maps-for-micro-frontends"">import maps</a>, which might eventually become part of the W3C standard.</p>",y
